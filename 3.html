    Creation at Netscape. The first web browser with a graphical user interface,
    Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played
    a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.
    The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation,
    which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994.
    This quickly became the most-used. During these formative years of the Web,
    web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior
    after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene
    to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator.
    They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language,
    while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.
